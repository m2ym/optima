Pattern Language
----------------

A pattern specifier, or a pattern for short unless ambiguous, is an
expression that describes how a value matches the pattern. Pattern
specifiers are defined as follows:

    pattern-specifier ::= constant-pattern
                        | variable-pattern
                        | symbol-macro-pattern
                        | constructor-pattern
                        | derived-pattern
                        | guard-pattern
                        | not-pattern
                        | or-pattern
                        | and-pattern

    constant-pattern ::= t | nil
                       | atom-except-symbol
                       | (quote VALUE)

    variable-pattern ::= SYMBOL | (variable SYMBOL)

    symbol-macro-pattern ::= (symbol-macrolet SYMBOL)

    constructor-pattern ::= (NAME ARG*)

    derived-pattern ::= (NAME PATTERN*)

    guard-pattern ::= (when TEST-FORM)

    not-pattern ::= (not PATTERN)

    or-pattern ::= (or PATTERN*)

    and-pattern ::= (and PATTERN*)

### Constant-Pattern

A constant-pattern matches the constant itself.

Examples:

    (match 1 (1 2)) => 2
    (match \"foo\" (\"foo\" \"bar\")) => \"bar\"
    (match '(1) ('(1) 2)) => 2

### Variable-Pattern

A variable-pattern matches any value and bind the value to the
variable. _ and otherwise is a special variable-pattern (a.k.a
wildcard-pattern) which matches any value but doesn't bind.

Examples:

    (match 1 (x x)) => 1
    (match 1 (_ 2)) => 2
    (match 1
      (2 2)
      (otherwise 'otherwise))
    => OTHERWISE

### Symbol-Macro-Pattern

A symbol-macro-pattern matches any value as variable-patterns but bind
the value with SYMBOL-MACROLET.

Examples:

    (defvar c (cons 1 2))
    (match c ((cons (symbol-macrolet x) y) (incf x) (incf y)))
    c
     => (2 . 2)

### Constructor-Pattern

A constructor-pattern matches not a value itself but a structure of
the value. The following constructors are available:

#### CONS

Syntax:

    cons-constructor-pattern ::= (cons CAR-PATTERN CDR-PATTERN)

Examples:

    (match '(1 . 2)
      ((cons a b) (+ a b)))
     => 3

#### VECTOR

Syntax:

    vector-constructor-pattern ::= (vector PATTERN*)

Examples:

    (match #(1 2)
      ((vector a b) (+ a b)))
    => 3

#### SIMPLE-VECTOR

Syntax:

    simple-vector-constructor-pattern ::= (simple-vector PATTERN*)

Examples:

    (match #(1 2)
      ((simple-vector a b) (+ a b)))
    => 3

#### CLASS

Mathces an instance of any class (of standard-class).

Syntax:

    class-constructor-pattern ::= (class NAME slot*)
                                | (NAME slot*)

    slot ::= SLOT-NAME
           | (SLOT-NAME PATTERN*)

CLASS can be omitted. If slot is a symbol, then it will be regarded
as (slot slot). If more than one PATTERN are given, then they will be
wrapped by and-pattern like (and PATTERN*).

Examples:

    (defclass point ()
      ((x :initarg :x)
       (y :initarg :y)))
    (defvar p (make-instance 'point :x 1 :y 2))
    (match p
      ((point x y) (list x y)))
    => (1 2)
    (match p
      ((point (x 1 x) _) x))
    => 1
    (defstruct person (name age))
    (defvar foo (make-person :name \"foo\" :age 30))
    (match foo
      ((person name age) (list name age)))
    => (\"foo\" 30)

#### STRUCTURE

Mathces an any value of a structure.

Syntax:

    structure-constructor-pattern ::= (structure CONC-NAME slot*)
                                    | (CONC-NAME slot*)

    slot ::= SLOT-NAME
           | (SLOT-NAME PATTERN*)

As well as CLASS constructor-pattern, STRUCTURE can be
omitted. CONC-NAME is a prefix string of a predicate (CONC-NAME +
\"p\") and accessors (CONC-NAME + SLOT-NAME). For example, if we have
the following defstruct,

    (defstruct person name age)

the structure constructor-pattern (person- name age) is valid because
PERSON-P, PERSON-NAME and PERSON-AGE are available here. Technically,
we don't need a structure defined. If we have the following code, for
instance,

    (defun point-p (p) (consp p))
    (defun point-x (p) (car p))
    (defun point-y (p) (cdr p))

the pattern matching below is valid.

    (match (cons 1 2)
      ((point- x y) (list x y)))
    => (1 2)

Examples:

    (defstruct (person (:conc-name :p-)
                       (:predicate p-p))
      name age)
    (match (make-person :name \"foo\" :age 30)
      ((p- name age) (list name age)))
    => (\"foo\" 30)

### Dervied-Pattern

A derived-pattern is a pattern that is defined with DEFPATTERN. There
are some builtin dervied patterns as below:

#### LIST

Expansion of LIST derived patterns=

    (list a b c) => (cons a (cons b (cons c nil)))

#### LIST*

Expansion of LIST* derived patterns:

    (list a b c) => (cons a (cons b c))

#### TYPEP

Expansion of TYPEP derived patterns:

    (TYPEP string) => (and #:G1 (when (typep #:G1 'string)))

#### SATISFIES

Expansion of SATISFIES derived patterns:

    (satisfies evenp) => (and #:G1 (when (evenp #:G1)))

### Guard-Pattern

A guard-pattern is a special pattern that tests TEST-FORM satisfies in
the current matching context. Guard-patterns are basically used with
and-patterns. See the examples below.

Examples:

    (match 1 ((and x (when (evenp x))) 'even))
    => NIL

### Not-Pattern

A not-pattern matches a value that is not matched with sub-PATTERN.

Examples:

    (match 1 ((not 2) 3)) => 3
    (match 1 ((not (not 1)) 1)) => 1

### Or-Pattern

An or-pattern matches a value that is matched with one of
sub-PATTERNs. There is a restriction that every pattern of
sub-PATTERNs must have same set of variables.

Examples:

    (match '(2 . 1) ((or (cons 1 x) (cons 2 x)) x))
    => 1

### And-Pattern

An and-pattern matches a value that is matched with all of
sub-PATTERNs. The most common use case is to match a value and bind
the value to a variable.

Examples:

    (match 1 ((and 1 x) x))
    => 1"
